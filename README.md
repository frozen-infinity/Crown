# Installation

  There is a `cr0wn.sh` script in this repository. You can use it via executing the following:
  `curl -sS https://github.com/frozen-infinity/Crown/blob/main/cr0wn.sh | sh`

  It will install required dependencies, configure NetworkManager to use iwd backend (required for the wifi widget to work), and copy the configuration files to the `.config` directory.

# Usage

In this setup there are the following shortcuts:
